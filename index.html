      <h1>Trees: A Webpage</h1>
    <p>I find <a href="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/oak-tree-7507678.jpg" title="Tree Pic"
         target="_blank">trees</a> very <strong>interesting</strong>. They are very <strong>neat</strong>. 
         They are very <strong>green</strong> 
         and I like them a <strong>lot</strong>. Sometime their leaves change colors and they <strong>die</strong>. 
        But then they just get back up again and <strong>live</strong>.</p>
